at last a display of vanity so pure it could be bottled and sold as perfume for the terminally self-absorbed
every time i think we’ve hit the bottom someone brings a jackhammer and a ring light
the triumph of the dull over the silent continues unabated
i am astonished not by the content but by the courage it took to post it
this is not a post it is a cry for help disguised as a brunch photo
the internet has found yet another way to make the ordinary appear revolutionary
this reeks of effort untempered by taste
a fine example of what happens when ego meets free time
somewhere a dictionary weeps
not since nero fiddled has so much spectacle accompanied so little substance
what you lack in insight you make up for in confidence
i salute your commitment to being perceived at any cost
this content has the nutritional value of styrofoam but is far more expensive
proof that the algorithm rewards the persistent not the perceptive
there is a special kind of genius in mistaking volume for value
were this any more self-congratulatory it would hand itself a trophy
every word here is a crime against syntax and sense
like watching a man explain fire to the sun
a masterclass in how to say absolutely nothing for maximum attention
this isn’t a post it’s a mirror held up to an empty room
impressive in the way a collapsing bridge is impressive
i can’t tell if this is satire or just postmodern despair
a compelling argument for the return of gatekeeping
there is no punchline here only a slow realization that you meant every word
the depth here rivals a puddle in a drought
a sobering reminder that we have made communication cheap and meaning rarer still
no doubt this will be studied in future civilizations as a warning
you’ve created something truly unforgettable if only for the wrong reasons
in an age of noise you have managed to be the loudest
a shining example of what happens when literacy and wisdom part ways
there is art in this but it is the art of the grift
