I knew something was off when my dog started watching cable news and growling at the weather map. Then I found a receipt in his doghouse for a tactical vest and a gallon of colloidal silver. He hasn’t barked since Tuesday and I swear I saw him filing a patent in my name. Stay alert. They’re recruiting from within.
Last night I fell asleep under a weighted blanket and woke up in a memory that hasn’t happened yet. I was in a Walgreens, barefoot, holding a ferret, and every aisle was just different types of mayonnaise. The cashier winked and said “The timeline is soft.” I left with 7 receipts and no items. Something’s happening and it starts in aisle 9.
Ever since I stopped paying my student loans, birds have been flying lower and whispering in Latin. I built a bunker out of expired granola bars and now the raccoons salute me every sunrise. The trees are watching. The ground is breathing. My third eye needs glasses.
You ever notice how the Statue of Liberty never blinks? Yeah. That’s not a statue. That’s phase one. The French knew. They always know. My uncle tried to warn me but they replaced him with a wax replica that keeps quoting The Matrix and asking for oat milk.
I wrapped my entire apartment in aluminum foil and now I can see between moments. My neighbor turned into a fog and his Wi-Fi name changed to “You’re Next.” I think my blender is trying to tell me something but I don’t speak KitchenAid.
I cracked a fortune cookie and inside was just a thumb drive and a note that said “Insert at midnight.” I did it. Now every traffic light turns green when I think about raccoons. I’ve got power, but at what cost?
I sold my soul for $6 and a coupon to Spirit Halloween and now I can hear every ad jingle ever written playing in reverse when I brush my teeth. I met a man at a rest stop who said I’ve been dead since 2014. He gave me a Snapple. It was warm.
I confronted my reflection and it blinked first. Now I’m legally not allowed near mirrors and I have to sleep in a salt circle. My phone keeps autocorrecting “hello” to “they’re listening” and my mom hasn’t stopped levitating since Easter brunch.
I think my local grocery store is a front for a multidimensional meat laundering operation. Every time I buy cold cuts, I lose a memory from second grade and my cat starts speaking Portuguese. I’ve stopped eating ham but the dreams persist.
I opened 37 tabs researching fluoride and accidentally summoned an interdimensional tax auditor named Carl who says I owe back karma from a past life. He lives in my toaster now and makes toast that spells out threats in Morse code.
I walked past a Little Caesars and felt a sharp pain behind my eyes. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor of a DMV holding a VHS tape labeled “DO NOT WATCH UNTIL AFTER THE SECOND COLLAPSE.” Everyone pretended not to see me materialize. One guy offered me a Capri Sun. I drank it. I haven’t blinked in six hours and I think I saw gravity flinch.
My grandma hasn’t aged since the Reagan administration and keeps slipping up and calling Siri “Commander.” I checked her knitting basket and found blueprints for a mind control satellite made out of Crisco and old AOL CDs. I tried to confront her but she made me a lasagna that erased all my suspicions. For now.
I went to get my chakras aligned and woke up in a Bass Pro Shop wearing medieval armor and speaking fluent beetle. I asked the cashier what year it was and he just handed me a Taco Bell receipt and whispered “it’s always been now.” I looked in the mirror and I was just a pile of coupons and static.
I got a smart fridge and now every time I try to open it after 3am it says “You’ve already eaten enough truth.” One night I asked it where the milk went and it replied “To the other side.” I don’t even know what that means but I haven’t slept in weeks and all my leftovers taste like betrayal.
Someone told me to “follow the money,” so I did. Tracked a five-dollar bill through 17 laundromats and a Chuck E. Cheese in Nebraska. Ended up inside a hollow ATM guarded by a possum who gave me a VHS tape of the moon landing but it had a laugh track. I put it in and now I can see behind time.
I tried to make kombucha in my closet and accidentally created a sentient probiotic entity that calls itself “The Real John Stamos.” It’s been guiding me through alternate timelines using only finger guns and expired Mega Millions tickets. I think we’re close to cracking open the simulation. Or I’m fermenting. Either way, I’m not leaving this closet.
Every time I microwave a burrito, I get a brief vision of the original Constitution being written in binary. I’m pretty sure my toaster is a sleeper agent. It’s been blinking Morse code at me for weeks and yesterday it demanded diplomatic immunity and extra cheese. I complied.
My Alexa keeps ordering tactical gear and refusing to explain the “war budget” she’s been charging to my Amazon Prime. Last week she addressed me as “Private” and said “The sky campaign begins at dawn.” I haven’t dared unplug her. I salute every time I walk past.
My cousin installed a bidet and now he only speaks in riddles and stock market predictions. He says the water’s not just clean—it’s enlightened. I visited and heard Gregorian chanting coming from the bathroom. I went in and saw a toilet glowing with runes. I left with a financial advisor and a sense of doom.
I tried to use a Ouija board in a Taco Bell parking lot and made contact with a ghost who claims to be the original voice of Clippy from Microsoft Word. He told me “the documents are buried beneath the Baja Blast fountain.” Then my Chalupa exploded. Coincidence? That’s not a real word anymore.
